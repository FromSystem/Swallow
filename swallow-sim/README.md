# Swallow-sim
Trace-driven simulator for flow(coflow) scheduling used in **Swallow**.   
Two subprojects are contained --- **flow** and **coflow**, based on minimizing FCT and CCT respectively.   
Swallow-traces are synthesized in porject [swallow-benchmark](https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow/tree/master/swallow-benchmark).
